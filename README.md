# SappySpirits
Sappy Spirits is an open-source NFT project for beginners. 

It consists of two parts: 
1. AutoCombiner
2. dApp

## AutoCombiner

Auto Combiner is a Python script that takes layers of PNGs and combines them according to the rarities assigned to make NFTs. It then attaches metadata to the pictures generated for them to be compatible with marketplaces like Opensea

## dApp

The dApp (decentralized app) is an NFT minting web page written in vanilla JS, HTML, CSS and web3.js. It allows user to mint NFTs by interacting with a contract.
